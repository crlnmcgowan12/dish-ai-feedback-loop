# CampusDish Insights https://preview--dish-ai-feedback-loop.lovable.app

## Project Description

CampusDish Insights is a mobile-first application meticulously designed to enhance the university student dining experience. This innovative solution provides students with seamless, real-time access to daily dining hall menus, empowering them to make informed choices about their meals. Beyond simply displaying menus, CampusDish Insights aggregates valuable feedback from the student community through item ratings and historical data analysis. By leveraging the collective wisdom of their peers, students can discover popular dishes, identify hidden gems, and avoid less favorable options.

The ultimate goal of CampusDish Insights is to foster an environment of transparency and informed decision-making within the university dining ecosystem. By providing students with the tools they need to navigate their dining options effectively, the application aims to improve their overall satisfaction with campus dining services. Furthermore, the insights gleaned from student interactions, preferences, and feedback have the potential to inform and shape future menu planning by university food services. This creates a powerful feedback loop that enables dining hall staff to respond to student needs, optimize their offerings, and cultivate a more responsive and satisfying dining experience for the entire university community.

This project distinguishes itself through its ambitious methodology: a commitment to leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) as the primary engine for generating all critical project components. From the initial stages of requirements gathering and system design to code implementation, testing, and documentation, a suite of AI tools is employed to execute each phase of an Agile-inspired development lifecycle. This approach necessitates a structured framework that emphasizes iterative progress, continuous AI-driven generation and validation, and adaptability to the evolving outputs and insights provided by the AI.

## Functional Documentation

The application provides a comprehensive suite of functionalities designed to empower students and enhance their dining experience:

* **FR01: Intelligent Menu Data Acquisition:** The system autonomously identifies, accesses, and intelligently parses the current day's menu data for all designated campus dining hall locations. This process involves interacting with specified and reliable data sources, such as university-provided links with menus and data. AI is responsible for understanding the data source structure, extracting relevant information, and gracefully handling potential data source unavailability, format changes, or inconsistencies through automated adaptation or error reporting. This ensures that the application always presents students with the most up-to-date and accurate menu information.
* **FR02: AI-Driven Real-time Menu Display:** The website, with its UI generated by AI, presents the retrieved menu data in a clear, organized, and user-friendly format. Menus are intelligently categorized by dining hall and meal period (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner), allowing students to quickly find the information they need. The AI determines the optimal layout and presentation based on usability principles and platform-specific guidelines, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience across both iOS and Android platforms.
* **FR03: Authenticated User Rating (Future):** In future phases of development, once AI-driven user authentication is implemented, logged-in users will be able to submit numerical ratings for individual menu items. This feature will allow students to express their opinions on specific dishes, contributing to the collective feedback that informs menu planning. The AI will generate the necessary UI elements and backend logic to support this functionality, ensuring a secure and user-friendly rating process.
* **FR04: Anonymous Rating Submission (Initial):** During the initial phase of the application, users can submit anonymous ratings for menu items. This allows students to provide feedback without creating an account, lowering the barrier to entry and encouraging widespread participation. To mitigate the risk of excessive voting and ensure data integrity, the AI generates the UI for this functionality and the backend logic to associate these ratings with a device identifier (generated and managed by AI).
* **FR05: Intelligent Rating Persistence:** Submitted ratings, along with their associated metadata, are securely stored in the backend database. This metadata includes the rating value, a timestamp of the submission, the unique identifier of the menu item, the identifier of the dining hall where the item was served, and the submission method (authenticated user ID or anonymous device ID). The AI defines the optimal data structure and storage mechanisms to ensure efficient data retrieval and analysis.
* **FR06: AI-Powered Real-time Rating Aggregation:** The backend, driven by AI-generated algorithms, calculates and maintains a real-time average rating for each menu item based on all valid submitted ratings. This average is updated within one second of a new rating submission, providing students with immediate feedback on the popularity and quality of dishes. The AI optimizes the aggregation process for efficiency, ensuring that the application can handle a high volume of ratings without performance degradation.
* **FR07: AI-Generated Historical Rating Display:** Users can view the historical average rating trend for a selected menu item over a defined period (e.g., the past week, month). This feature allows students to see how a dish's popularity and quality have changed over time, helping them make more informed decisions about whether to try it. The AI generates the backend logic to retrieve and aggregate this historical data and the mobile application UI (e.g., a simple line graph) to present it visually in an easy-to-understand format.
* **FR08: Efficient Data Synchronization:** The mobile application, guided by AI-driven optimization strategies, efficiently synchronizes menu data and ratings with the backend service. This synchronization occurs upon launch and periodically in the background, ensuring that the app always displays the latest information while minimizing data usage and battery consumption. The AI determines the optimal synchronization frequency and data transfer methods to balance performance and resource efficiency.
